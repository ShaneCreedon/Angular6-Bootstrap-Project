#### Angular 5 / 6 project
---

###### Goal:

Fully dynamic website involving **Bootstrap** to maintain a responsive design alongside **CSS Grids**.  
In addition, I will be using **Angular 5 / 6** to create a single-page MVC website model.  
Other technologies: **NodeJS + Npm**

###### End Goal:

A fully responsive, dynamic, useful dashboard that hosts all the tenant health data.  
It shows the *critical tenants* and the *low health tenants* as priority.  
This is where the dynamism comes into the site.
